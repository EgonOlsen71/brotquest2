# Brotquest2 - Kiss me Amiga

This the successor to Brotquest, an example text adventure that I wrote for my XAM adventure parser.

It's in german, your goal is to obtain an Amiga in one way of the other.

You can find the compiled game in the d64-image in the build directory. If you need help, have a look at the help-directory. It contains a map and a solution to the game.
